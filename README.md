The idea is to make it easy to view OCT files from various commercial OCT systems. 

E2Eviewer uses the oct_converter library to read the data an metadata and display 
the fundus photo with OCT cross section. The approximate location of the scan is highlighted 
on the fundus and you can navigate the scan location and eye (or data set) by arrow keys.
Note: this is only tested on a limited type of scan and may need modifcation to view other 
scan geometries. 
TODO: test more scan geometries, display more metadata, provide option to export 

Thorlabs viewer is currently in very rough shape and should not be used. Plans to to 
improve this code will be executed as time allows, but may provide a starting point.
